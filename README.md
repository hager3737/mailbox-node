# MAILBOX-NODE

## üìñ Overview  
This node is part of the **Hager Smart Home** system and is responsible for detecting motion in the mailbox. It sends a message via **LoRa** to the **bridge-node**, which then relays the information to the web server backend. This setup allows me to monitor mailbox activity remotely, even though Wi-Fi doesn‚Äôt reach the mailbox itself.

The mailbox node uses a **PIR motion sensor** to detect activity and an **SX1278 LoRa module** to send a "Hello" message to the bridge node whenever motion is detected.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality  
This node is responsible for motion detection in the mailbox and sending the detection data to the **bridge-node** via **LoRa**. Here's a breakdown of its core functionality:

### 1. Motion Detection (PIR Sensor)  
- The device uses a **PIR motion sensor** to detect movement.  
- When motion is detected, the device sends a LoRa message ("Hello") to the **bridge-node** via the **SX1278 LoRa module**.

### 2. LoRa Transmission (SX1278)  
- The **SX1278 LoRa module** is initialized for transmission with the following settings:
  - **Frequency**: 437 MHz
  - **Spreading Factor**: **SF9**
  - **Bandwidth**: **125 kHz**
  - **Sync Word**: **0x12**
  - **Preamble Length**: **8 symbols**
  - **Transmission Power**: Configured dynamically
  
- When motion is detected, the device triggers the **tx_callback** function, which sends a "Hello" message to the **bridge-node** over LoRa.

### 3. Message Transmission  
- The device sends a fixed "Hello" message containing the exact bytes `{ 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' }`.  
- The **tx_callback** function prepares and sends this message by first configuring the transmission settings, then sending the message and logging the bytes for debugging.
